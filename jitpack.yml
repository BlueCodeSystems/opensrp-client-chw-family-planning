jdk:
  - openjdk17

install:
  # Print versions for easier debugging in JitPack logs
  - ./gradlew --version
  # Build and publish the library AAR to the local Maven repository (~/.m2)
  # -x test keeps builds fast and avoids emulator/robolectric needs on JitPack
  - ./gradlew -PdisablePreDex :opensrp-chw-family-planning:publishToMavenLocal -x test --no-daemon --stacktrace

# Notes:
# - No signing is performed. Signing in central-publish.gradle is only required
#   when -PcentralBundle=true or -PcentralRelease=true, which JitPack does not set.
# - The artifact will be installed to ~/.m2/repository under coordinates derived
#   from gradle.properties (GROUP, POM_SETTING_ARTIFACT_ID, VERSION_NAME).
